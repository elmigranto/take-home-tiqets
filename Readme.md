I used Python 3.11.6 with [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Since there are no external dependencies, chances are that `python3` binary already existing in your `PATH` will work as well. I made a small wrapper with optional watch mode for development. 

```shell
# Run using inputs from the assignment's zip-file:
./run

# Use specific CSVs:
./run \
  --orders ./data/orders.csv \
  --barcodes ./data/barcodes.csv
  
# More options:
./run --help

# Information about ./run itself:
./run help
```

You can trigger entrypoint directly and pass the same arguments that `run` accepts (technically, `run` forwards its arguments to entrypoint except for specific shortcuts like `./run test`).

```shell
python3 src/main.py
python3 src/main.py --help
```

Hope everything runs with 0 issues ðŸ¤ž

## ðŸš§ [Work-in-progress] Solution ðŸš§

Effectively, we need to perform a join with `group by`. One approach is to load everything into in-memory [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) and use `select`s for calculations. This yields a "free" bonus point as well :)

### Approach

At a high level, we'll need 3 parts:

 - `main()` with parsing arguments;
 - IO to read CSVs and write results;
 - Pure logic for the task itself.

## Assignment

We have exported 2 datasets from our system, one contains orders from customers and another contains barcodes (with an `order_id` if they are sold). To print the Tiqets vouchers we need a csv file with all the `barcode`s and `orders_id`s per customer.

Write a program that reads these two files, `orders.csv` and `barcodes.csv`, and generates an output file that contains the following data:

```
customer_id, order_id1, [barcode1, barcode2, ...]
customer_id, order_id2, [barcode1, barcode2, ...]
```

### Bonus points

 - We want to have the top 5 customers that bought the most amount of tickets. The script should print (to stdout) the top 5 customers of the dataset. Each line should be in the following format:
   ```
   customer_id, amount_of_tickets
   ```
 - Print the amount of unused barcodes (barcodes left).
 - Model how you would store this in a SQL database (e.g. UML, data model with relations and optionally indexes)

### Input files

Two files in comma separated formatting.

- **`orders.csv`** contains a list of orders, `order_id` is unique.
   ```
   order_id, customer_id
   ```
- **`barcodes.csv`** with the barcodes in our system. If a barcode has been sold, it's assigned to an order using `order_id`, otherwise `order_id` is empty.
   ```
   barcode, order_id
   ```

### Validation

Make sure the input is validated correctly:

 - No duplicate barcodes
 - No orders without barcodes

Items which failed the validation should be logged (e.g. `stderr`) and ignored for the output.

### Requirements

 - Write your solution in Python
 - Deliver solution using git or a zip file.
 - Runs out of the box and is production ready
